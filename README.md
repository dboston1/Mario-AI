# Mario-AI
This project details a reproduction of an artificial intelligence project to utilize AI to complete the first level in Super Mario Bros.

Please see **final.ipynb**.

*PLEASE NOTE:* the project portion of this report is a reproduction of the project done by Alex Lambert, whose github can be found here: https://github.com/wert23239/Meta-MarIO/tree/master/Lua/NES. 

I have uploaded this regardless, as *final.ipynb* includes a significant amount of detail on how the project was accomplished, and analysis of the code, and of the artifical intelligence approach. In short, it is a very informative and detailed explanation of why and how the code works, with videos, pictures, and illustrations.

The rest of the image/gif files are included simply as visual aids used by *final.ipynb*; they have little value on their own (so don't feel like you need to look through them if you don't want to). :)
